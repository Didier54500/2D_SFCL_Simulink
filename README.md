# 2D_SFCL_Simulink
We propsoed a 2D Electrothermal model of resisitive Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (rSFCL) using Simscape toolbox of Matlab.
Each layer can be parameterized from the Simulink interface.
A rSFCL_GitHub.m file is given for greater flexibility.
Ahtor have to be cited in all scientific papers that use the proposed model (see License file).
