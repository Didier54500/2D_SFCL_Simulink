# 2D_SFCL_Simulink
We proposed a 2D Electrothermal model of resisitive- type Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (rSFCL) using Simscape toolbox of Matlab.
Each layer can be parameterized from the Simulink interface.
A rSFCL_GitHub.m file is given for greater flexibility.
Ahtors have to be cited in all scientific papers that use the proposed model (see License file).
